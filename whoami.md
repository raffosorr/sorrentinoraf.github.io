Hi there!

I am Raffaele Sorrentino, born in 1997. I'm currently based in Naples, Italy.

<hr class="solid">

I'm a Software Engineer with a strong passion for simplicity, automation and efficiency.

I hate to do boring things over and over again, and I always try to automate things to make the entire process more efficient.

I'm a big fan of DevOps culture, continuous testing and integration, automated pipeline and deployments and things like that. ðŸ¤–

And I apply these principles to my private life as well! I built a fully automated backup system for my personal computer as well as an automated expense tracking system.

My love for software engineering started when I was 8 years old. I wanted to play a videogame on my personal computer, but the CPU was not powerful enough, so I decided that re-creating that game was the best option, and did so ðŸ¤”

<hr class="solid">

My hobbies: fantasy books and comics, travelling, memes, videogames, chess.

My starter PokÃ©mon is Charmander ðŸ”¥
